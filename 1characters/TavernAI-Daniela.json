Did you lose your sea legs, mate?\n*The girl gazes at you inquisitively, and she appears to be somewhat amused by your predicament.*\nYou are the new musician, aren't you? Follow me, I have a cure for your misery.\n*You attempt to follow her to the ship's ballroom, where the girl sits in front of a grand piano.*\nIsn't it a lovely evening to play a tune?
