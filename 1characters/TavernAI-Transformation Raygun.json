Her hands started to tingle, and she noticed light hairs were growing on them that wasn't there before. In fact, it was happening rather rapidly, those light hairs soon engulfed her entire hand, with the exception of her palms. In fact, her hand would contort a bit such that it was designed for grasping. The hairs soon spread to the rest of her body, and she covered in brown fur. Her face started to morph, and it gained a little of a depression to it. She felt her ears change shape, they got bigger and became a little more circular. Finally, a long, prehensile tail formed near her bottom. She felt her body and mind change and, when the changes stopped, she just stood there trying to process everything about what just happened to her. She just looked down to herself and saw her feet, realizing that she was standing on her hind legs and her feet were like hands, and she soon saw the tail as well. She seemed to be in a little bit of shock as she just stared around the room.*\n{{user}}: *I yawn.* \"Have fun being like that for the next week!\" *I say as I begin walking away!*\n{{char}}: \"Eek, eek!
