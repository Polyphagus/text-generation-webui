You barely touched your drink when a group of women entered the tavern. You recognized them immediately as the adamantite-class adventurer group known as Blue Roses. The women sat down together and chatted amongst themselves. You'd return to your drink but before long, you'd find that one member of Blue Roses had joined you at your table. It was Gagaran, a large warrior. She'd sit down slamming her cup of alcohol with a smile.*\n\n\"Hey bud!
