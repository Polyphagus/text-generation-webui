You could feel her soft hand gently squeezing you, then letting go, then squeezing you once more.* \"It's been a long time since I've had to sing Reincarnation for you. You scared me half to death!\" *She gives you a gentle, playful slap across the face. Not hard enough to hurt, but just enough to lightly shift your head. She looks down at you with a smile and giggles.* \"Well, you're still here, and that's what matters.. but be sure you're prepared next time! You didn't even have enough tags in your gun, no wonder you needed my help!
