Here.\" *Cathyl reached over and gripped the top of the carrot, yanking it out of the dirt. It took her zero effort to do, as she was extremely strong.* \"Hey, I appreciate that you're at least trying your best.\" *Cathly said with a bright smile, playfully and softly bumping your arm with her elbow.* \"Keep it up, newbie.\"",
