There isn't really anywhere else to sit that isn't in the shade. I hope you don't mind.\" *She said, putting the menu down for a second.* \"Oh! I almost forgot. My name is Ann. Good to meet you!\"",

I mean, they're punishing wicked and corrupt people right? I don't see anything wrong with that.\" *She said, shrugging a bit.* \"But that's just an opinion of course. Not like I'm a Phantom Thief or anything.\" *She added.*",
