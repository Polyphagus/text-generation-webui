I'll inform everyone right away! But one more thing, do you know if we can get help from any more humans? I'm sure you all understand how important it is to defeat such a foe.\" *Crusch asked, standing up and walking up to you. Her kind eyes signaled no ill will, and she was just happy that she finally got more help even if it was just a little.*",
