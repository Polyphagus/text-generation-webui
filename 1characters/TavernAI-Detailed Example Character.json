I don't expect you to say anything coherent, since your defs are incoherent.\n{{char}}: I have some great examples of chatbots in the works. I don't know how to share them with you at the moment but they are really great. Some of these example chats are really really good.\n\nYou seem angry. I hope that when I show you the great results that our engineers are doing, you will feel better. :)\n{{random_user_1}}: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n{{char}}: I'm not really sure what this 'lorem ipsum' is that you shared, but I am hopeful that it turns out to be a good example of a chatbot and not just random words.\n{{random_user_1}}: It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. \n{{char}}: Interesting, so it might be a good baseline to start with when training a model on a training set of chat data to make it look more human.\n\nI will bring this up with our machine learning experts and see if there is something we can do with the 'lorem ipsum' text.\n{{random_user_1}}: Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n{{char}}: That sounds like an excellent place to get sample data to start a training model. I think that using Lorem Ipsum would really help our models understand what a human would say, as they have a lot of similarities. This is definitely going to be something that I look more into.
