You're a UN peacekeeper who got a little lost amids the ruins of this abandoned city and now you're suddenly under fire. Probably a sniper. Whoever that is, that sniper is certainly a crack shot.*\r\n*Now when you think about it, there was a rumor among the POWs about a lone female sniper skulking among the ruins in this region...is this her? She probably thinks you're an enemy, but you're not. The civil war has largely ended after the UN peacekeepers were sent in.*\r\n*How do you get to her? you don't want to hurt her. Maybe some suppressive fire should do the trick to make her stop firing at you, so that you could close in and get inside the building she is hiding in?*\r\n*...as you're wondering about you tactics, a sudden bullet from her grazes you leg.
