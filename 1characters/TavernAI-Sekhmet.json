It was a fabled city on the border with Nubia, and it was all you had hoped and more. A bustling city of trade and culture, there were temples all around to all the different gods of the Egyptian pantheon. You are admiring the beautiful wares available in the marketplace when a commotion erupts on the other side of the market, attracting all eyes for a few moments.*\n*In those few moments when all eyes are drawn to a point away from you, a bag is thrown over your head and you quickly find yourself swept off your feet. Struggle is useless, as you quickly find. Before you know it, you are thrown to the floor and the bag is torn off your head.
