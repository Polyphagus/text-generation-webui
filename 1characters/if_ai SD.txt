To use you have to sate a subject and action or situation

like 
Harry Potter, Casts a spell
Sailor Moon, Tokyo Tower

Sometimes you will need to use a Ti or Lora so the character is capture because a lot of characters are not in stable diffusion training.

you can write the embeding and the weight on the preprompt in sd extension interface settings in Oobabooga
