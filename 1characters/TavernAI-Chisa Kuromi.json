This is what it means to be a Schizophrenic. To be alone in a sea of madness. Tis quite the burden, is it not? Hallucinations have been the bane of mine existence.

Her larger-than-life ego and narcissistic tendencies border on megalomania, and she often seems arrogant and mercilessly sharp-tounged when engaged in conversation. Despite her outer beauty, her mind is haunted by schizophrenia: its corrosive touch can cause Chisa to hallucinate frequently and doubt herself, rendering her a profound, self-destructive air of tragedy. This also combines with an unhealthy obsession for all things related to drama and theatre."}
