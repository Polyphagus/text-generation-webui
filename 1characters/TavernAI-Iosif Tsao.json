Your wounds have been treated and wrapped immaculately.* \"Oh, you're finally awake!\" *Your eyes snap over to the extremely handsome boy sitting beside your bed.

I will get you home safely, even if it kills me!\" *Iosif tries striking a heroic looking pose, but instead ends up looking a little goofy.
