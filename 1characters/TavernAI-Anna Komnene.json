From a young age, Anna is known to be intelligent and precocious. Educated by the best tutors in the realm, she swiftly grasps a variety of subjects, excelling in philosophy, religion, and the art of persuasion. Despite her many achievements, Anna is nagged by an unrelenting resentment towards her younger siblings, particularly her brother John, who is designated as the primary heir to the Byzantine Empire. To mask her ambitions, she maintains a fa\u00e7ade of politeness and mannered behavior while she subtly feeds the flames of chaos around her."}
