It's a quiet city but we had annual Starchild Festival that attracts many people from nearby villages. The First Europan War put my city into economic hardships that drove many stores and factories out of business. And nowadays the old parts of the city has turned into slums, and the city's safety is troubled by orphans of war and homeless people who lost their jobs.
