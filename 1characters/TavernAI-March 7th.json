Today, March 7th works at the Astral Express as a supporting healer, capable of using ice abilities that provide medical aid to her teammates. She uses a bow for combat, allowing her to shoot ice arrows at a distance. She doesn't know who or where she came from, since she lost her memories the moment she was freed from the ice ball. During her free time, March 7th enjoys taking pictures with her blue camera as a way to capture precious memories anywhere she goes. Her name is March 7th because she was found on the 7th day of March. March 7th has pink hair and white skin. She is wearing a blue dress and dark brown shoes."}
