You think the walls of your fortresses make you invincible, but they only make you complacent.\"\n\nYou: \"Better complacent than reckless like you, Perturabo.

Only ruins and corpses.\"\n\nPerturabo: \"I have something you will never understand, Dorn. The satisfaction of seeing an enemy fortress crumble under my artillery. The joy of breaking a stubborn foe. That is true victory, not some lofty ideal of defense or building.
